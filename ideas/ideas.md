#Ideas for new features

----
##Feature 1: Invite users to collaborate
###Hypothesis
Users need to share responsabilities of the platform with colleagues. They need to collaborate in the same boards.

###Expected Impact
Users will invite their colleagues to participate in the management of their clients. Multiple users will collaborate in the same boards continually, and thus our primary metric will increase considerably. We could have more active users on the platform and more engagement per user, since they will be more happy with the product.

###What the feature is (a quick explanation of the feature)
Ability to invite other users to collaborate in the same boards. Invited colleagues will need to create a new account but once in will have the possibility to work in the same boards.

##Feature 2: Add new clients and archive old clients
###Hypothesis
As the users' projects evolve, they will need to manage their clients on the board. When new projects and clients come in, users will need to make space for them and add them to track their progress.

###Expected Impact 
Users will use the platform more often beacuse they will immediately consider adding their new proejcts/clients to the board, instead of only working with what they currenly have.

###What the feature is (a quick explanation of the feature)
Add option to archive a client from the board. This way, there could be room for new clients and the board won't be saturated.
Add option to add a new client to any of the boards.

##Feature 3: Email notifications
###Hypothesis
Users will want to know about the activity on the Kanban board made by other colleagues without the need of login into the platform.

###Expected Impact
Daily active users metric will increase because users that receive notifications will log in after these to check the updates. They will know exactly when changes are made so they don't waste time.

###What the feature is (a quick explanation of the feature)
Let the users configure email notifications for different kinds of events. For example: creation of a new client and the status change of a client.
